This document includes script to add a new variable to the EMA data output. This script adds 'Day of Week' to the table. 
```{r}
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

```


First, read EMA data and select for variables of interest:
```{r}
EMA<- as_tibble(20210622_EMA.csv)
EMA <- EMA%>%
  select(`Record ID`,`Event Name`,`Repeat Instance`, `Survey Timestamp`, Distressed, Excited, Upset, Scared, Enthusiastic, Alert, Inspired, Nervous, Determined, Afraid)
```

Then, add 'DayofWeek' variable. THis will classify the weekday from the Survey Timestamp data.
```{r}
EMA <- EMA %>%
  mutate(DayofWeek = weekdays(as.Date(`Survey Timestamp`)), .after= `Survey Timestamp`)

```

Additional variable to classify Weekend and Weekday.
If    DayofWeek = Monday, then Class_DayofWeek = Weekday
      DayofWeek = Tuesday, then Class_DayofWeek = Weekday
      DayofWeek = Wednesday, then Class_DayofWeek = Weekday
      DayofWeek = Thursday, then Class_DayofWeek = Weekday
      DayofWeek = Friday, then Class_DayofWeek = Weekday
      DayofWeek = Saturday, then Class_DayofWeek = Weekend
      DayofWeek = Sunday, then Class_DayofWeek = Weekend
```{r}
  Monday <- "Monday"
  Tuesday <- "Tuesday"
  Wednesday <- "Wednesday"
  Thursday <- "Thursday"
  Friday <- "Friday"
  Saturday <- "Saturday"
  Sunday <- "Sunday"
  
attach(EMA)
  Cat_DayofWeek[DayofWeek==Monday] <- "Weekday"
  Cat_DayofWeek [DayofWeek==Tuesday]<-"Weekday"
  Cat_DayofWeek [DayofWeek==Wednesday]<-"Weekday"
  Cat_DayofWeek [DayofWeek==Thursday]<-"Weekday"
  Cat_DayofWeek [DayofWeek==Friday]<-"Weekday"
  Cat_DayofWeek [DayofWeek==Saturday]<-"Weekend"
  Cat_DayofWeek [DayofWeek==Sunday]<-"Weekend"

EMA <- EMA %>%
  mutate(Cat_DayofWeek=Cat_DayofWeek, .after=DayofWeek)
```
